# About me ðŸ¦Š

## **Cinnamon-147** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Cinnamon-147

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a movie personality analysis project based on Douban data and MBTI types
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Git/GitHub, data analysis with Python, and front-end development for visualization
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on small creative data-driven projects â€” especially those about film, games, or psychology
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with deploying interactive pages (like Streamlit or React) and improving project structure

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about:
  
  *ðŸŽ¬ what makes a movie feel like a memory, not just a story*

  *ðŸŽ® replaying narrative games just to feel again*

  *âœ¨ late-night productivity and early-morning regret*
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: (liyinggan7@gamil.com) or just message me on GitHub
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- ðŸŽµ Fun fact: I believe productivity peaks at 3AM, with only Lana Del Rey singing softly and silence for company.
